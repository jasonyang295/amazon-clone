# Amazon Clone Built in React
Disclaimer: All rights to the original Amazon website and web services belong to its respective owner. I am in no way affiliated with Amazon business/legal-wise. This is merely a project I decided to take on in order to improve my development skills in React. 

This project was done in React and deployed (partially) with firebase. Unfortunately, since firebase updated their CI/CD guidelines, there is no live deployment of this site. I ran it locally on my computer using the React documentation, which can be found below if you have confusion. 

## Implementation and Features
This application features the Amazon home page, a login / logout feature, and the shopping cart + checkout / payment page. You can't search for products as I don't have access to every product sold on Amazon, but I imported some products into the app and you can add those to your cart. It isn't as expansive as Amazon (obviously), but it does function just like it for all the featured products, which include the shopping cart updating and the automatic price calculation. The database used is the free online db hosted by firebase. 


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
